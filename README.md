# Email_Template_Editing_Tool


Its just a Tool to Learn CSS properties and how it works.

I got an Idea to create this tool from W3Schools. 

In W3Scholl you could see a playgroung where you could test different css properties.
This doses the same but It has all the CSS Properties to test it out.

To use this vrion of the Tool You could just directly download and open the index.html.

Just drang the elements to the playground and change the CSS properties.
All the CSS properties are applies as an inline Style.
