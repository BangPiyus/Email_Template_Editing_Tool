# Email_Template_Editing_Tool


This Tool helps to modify the existing Template and alos learn CSS Properties.

I got an Idea to create this tool from W3Schools. 

In W3Scholl you could see a playgroung where you could test different css properties.
This doses the same but It has all the CSS Properties to test it out.

To use this version of the Tool You could just directly download and open the index.html.

Just drang the elements to the playground element and change the CSS properties.
All the CSS properties are applies as an inline Style.

you could also play with Bootstrap components.

You could also directly edit your source with the help of the split view and Source view.
you could swap the elements, preview the page,clone the element and also delete the elements.

The selectors can also be used here to modify more than one element style in the webpage.

To modify the existing Template just copy the source code form your template and just paste it in this tool source view.
