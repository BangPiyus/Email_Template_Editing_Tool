# Email_Template_Editing_Tool


This Tool helps to modify the existing Template and alos learn CSS Properties.

I got an Idea to create this tool from W3Schools. 

In W3Scholl you could see a playgroung where you could test different css properties.
This doses the same but It has all the CSS Properties to test it out.

To use this version of the Tool you must need a local server to run.

Many functionalities has been impolemented compared to the previous verion of this tool.

I have also provided a standard email templates to use. Breadcrum to navigate the elements,
Edit in place, browse your local files etc...
