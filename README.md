# Email_Template_Editing_Tool


This Tool helps to modify the existing Template and alos learn CSS Properties.

I got an Idea to create this tool from W3Schools. 

In W3Scholl you could see a playgroung where you could test different css properties.
This doses the same but It has all the CSS Properties to test it out.

To use this version of the Tool you must need a local server to run.

New feature has been implemented. That is,

in the Selector Field you colud use "this" keyword that mentions the currently selected element.

For ex: You have selected a table element which has no classs or id but still you wish to change the css of all tr/td elements
of that particular element. So the best way to do is that,
Select the table and in the select type the following

"this tr" (or) "this td" (or) "this tr:first-child" etc..

by this way you could all the elements inside the currently selected element.
